# til (Today I learned)

A compilation of insights I gained today. These are small tidbits I picked up from others through pull requests, pair programming, or articles. This repository is largely inspired by [jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) and [simonw](https://github.com/simonw/til).
